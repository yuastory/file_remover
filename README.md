# file_remover
  - When you create directories inside directories, you can find that you cannot remove them in Windows OS.
  - This will help you remove by dragging into a panel this app provides.


â€» Be careful to use, no alert message, no warning appears, so when you dragged your files or directories, they are already gone.
